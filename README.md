#Vulnerability-Managment-Project-with-Nessus;

Created a VM with VMware 17 and successfully connected VM with Nessus on local host. Created vulnerabilities on VM such as removing firewall protections, creating credentials and installing a deprecated version of Mozilla Firefox to analyze vulnerabilites/threats and remediate these issues.

Screenshots in order:

- Second scan of VM with credentials enabled which created issues relating to Windows 10 and MicroSoft System Center Endpoint Protection

- Third scan of VM with credentials enabled and a old version of Mozilla FireFox installed (3.6.12). This unsupported browser created multiple vulnerabilites on Nessus

To remediate these issues, Nessus recommended to install the latest version of Mozilla Firefox, update the security protections on Windows such as Defender and EndPoint Protection and add further protections towards credential login.
